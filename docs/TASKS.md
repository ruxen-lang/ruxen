# Ruxen — Task Index

**Canonical task list for the Ruxen compiler/toolchain.** This is a roll-up
over the authoritative backlogs below — it does not replace them, it tells you
where each kind of work lives and what is open *right now*. Keep it current
(see `../CLAUDE.md` → "Task tracking & keeping context current").

## Open now — GUI-stack ledger (`dev/gui-stack-v1-issues.md`)

30 of 34 fixed (Q23–Q26 surfaced 2026-06-08; Q16 fixed 2026-06-08 on
feat/drop-elaboration; Q29 audited 2026-06-09 — already sound, pinned; Q28, Q30,
Q31 fixed 2026-06-09; Q32, Q33 fixed 2026-06-10; **Q34 NEW 2026-06-10**). The
canvas `Int`→`Float32` event-coord revert (unblocked by Q28/Q31) has LANDED
(canvas 143 green, sub-pixel pinned, live windowed loop verified).

- [ ] **Q34 · S2 — `ruxen fmt` drops grouping parentheses, silently changing
      arithmetic.** `(rel*span + track_w/2)/track_w` →
      `rel*span + track_w/2/track_w` (division now binds first) — broke quiver's
      slider math until hand-reverted. Third fmt-destructiveness facet (Q23 docs,
      Q30 call shapes, Q34 grouping); the recurring root cause is re-emitting
      from an AST that doesn't preserve grouping. Fix + idempotence pin per
      `dev/gui-stack-v1-issues.md` §Q34. Until then: do NOT bulk-run `ruxen fmt`
      on the GUI repos.

- [x] **Q32 · S3 — Q16 flat-merge of an FFI dependency broke `ruxen test` at
      link (FIXED 2026-06-10).** A consumer's test EXECUTABLE flat-merged the
      FFI dep's `src/**.rx` (incl. `lib "C"`-calling bodies) but neither
      compiled its `runtime/**.c` nor propagated its `[system_libs]` → every
      `ruxen_*` symbol undefined at link. Fix (option (b)): the test runner now
      gathers each flat-merged dep's `runtime/**.c`
      (`codegen::find_runtime_sources_in_dir`) and forwards each dep's
      `[system_libs]` (`codegen::parse_system_libs`) as `--link-arg=-l<lib>`
      (new repeatable `ruxenc` flag), mirroring exactly what `compile_project`
      gathers for a directly-declared dep; `compile_project` also gained the
      dep `[system_libs]` propagation it was missing. `src/ruxenc/test_runner.rs`,
      `src/ruxenc/compile.rs`, `src/ruxen_cli/build.rs`. Pins (staged install,
      RUN + assert): `src/ruxen_cli/tests/ffi_dep_link.rs` (FFI-dep test links +
      passes; binary declaring the dep directly has no dup-symbol; non-FFI dep
      still links). Details in `dev/gui-stack-v1-issues.md` §Q32.
- [x] **Q33 · S2 — `Float32 == <negative Int literal>` evaluated false (FIXED
      2026-06-10).** The `Compare` MIR instruction is width-blind; codegen
      coerced the rhs to the lhs's SSA type with the signedness-BLIND
      `coerce_value` (`fcvt_from_uint`), so a signed `Int(-1)` (i64 `0xFFFF…`)
      became `1.8e19` and `f == -1` was false. The ordering ops (`>=`/`<`) and
      the literal-on-the-left shape broke too; positive literals and f32==f32
      were accidentally fine. Fix: re-materialize a mismatched numeric operand
      pair to a common float width via a target-typed `Assign` before the
      `Compare` (`coerce_compare_operands` in `mir/lower/expr/binops.rs`),
      invoking codegen's Q5 signedness-aware int→float path. Backend-agnostic
      (shared MIR); mirrors Q28's `coerce_to_field_ty`. Pins (RUN + assert
      stdout): `tests/release-e2e/cases/653_f32_negative_int_literal_compare`,
      `654_enum_f32_payload_negative_compare` +
      `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q33_negative_literal_float_compare.rs`.

- [x] **Q28 · S1 — `Float32` field/payload store-via-local → 0 / crash (FIXED 2026-06-09).**
      The struct/enum/tuple constructor lowering stored each field value
      width-blind (at the value's SSA width) into a fixed 8-byte slot; an f64
      value into an f32 field stored 8 bytes, and the f32 `GetField` read 4 →
      0. Fix: coerce each constructor arg to the FIELD's declared width via a
      target-typed `Assign` (`coerce_to_field_ty` → shared `coerce_value`
      fdemote/fpromote path) BEFORE the `SetField`, in
      `mir/lower/expr/constructors.rs` (Construct/EnumVariant/Tuple) and the
      struct auto-ctor in `method_call.rs`. Backend-agnostic (shared MIR). All
      four shapes now print 204.75; the e2e pins RUN + assert stdout. Pins:
      `tests/release-e2e/cases/650_f32_field_store_via_local`,
      `651_enum_f32_payload_via_local` (+ 647/648) and
      `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q28_enum_float_payload.rs`.
- [x] **Q30 · S4 — `ruxen fmt` rewrote builder-closure call shapes (FIXED 2026-06-09).**
      `fmt` dropped a no-arg closure header (`{ || … }` → `{ … }`, a crash
      shape) and stripped `()` off a zero-arg call (`row_height()` →
      `row_height`, a call→identifier semantic change). Fix: a zero-param
      `ClosureExpr` always formats with an explicit `||`, and a `Call` node
      always emits its parens (it only exists when the source wrote `()`).
      `formatter/format_expr.rs`. The brace block-arg is already preserved as
      braces. Round-trip pins in `q23_fmt_nondestructive.rs`.
- [x] **Q31 · S1 — repeated `Float`-payload enum construction crashed: enum
      UNDER-ALLOCATION (FIXED 2026-06-09).** `alloc_size` sized enums to packed
      `layout.size` while codegen addresses payloads on a fixed 8-byte slot
      stride (`GetPayload` = base+8, field N at N*8), so `Move(Float32,Float32)`
      stored field 1 four bytes past the 16-byte alloc → heap-metadata
      corruption → crash on the next float `malloc` (hence ≥2 constructions; Int
      payloads on 8-byte slots survived). Fix: slot-round enum allocations to
      `8 + widest_variant_field_count*8` in `mir/lower/emit.rs` (no drops/codegen
      change; enum dealloc was already sound — 3 allocs/3 frees). Pins run+assert
      stdout: `tests/release-e2e/cases/652_enum_float_payload_double_construct`,
      `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q31_float_enum_payload_drop.rs`,
      `drop_fixtures.rs::q31_…_no_leak`. Unblocks canvas `Int`→`Float32` coords.
- [x] **Q16 · S4 — dependency symbols invisible to library/`check`/`test` builds
      (FIXED).** Library (`compile_piece`), `check`, and `ruxen test` now
      flat-merge dependency `src/**.rx` via the shared `build::gather_dep_sources`
      + `build::resolve_dep_source_dirs`, the same mechanism binary builds use.
      `rondo`/`quiver` can now unit-test against their own public API directly.
      Pin: `src/ruxen_cli/tests/dep_visibility.rs`.
- [x] **Q17 · S4 — generic-free-fn / mixin-bound monomorphization for consumer types.**
      ✅ FIXED for generic FREE FUNCTIONS (feat/drop-elaboration, 2026-06-10).
      Re-scoped empirically: post-Q16 this is a single-unit MIR-lowering gap, not
      cross-package. A generic free fn over a mixin now monomorphizes per concrete
      implementor (incl. generic-calling-generic via a worklist fixpoint), so a
      consumer binary can define a SECOND `PaintSurface` implementor and call the
      dep's generic against both — quiver's framework cap is lifted. Design:
      `docs/decisions/q17-cross-package-monomorphization.md`. **STAGED REMAINDER:**
      generic METHODS over a mixin (a generic `def` inside a class) are not yet
      monomorphized — now a clear lowering error, never a placeholder symbol (see
      below). Also out of scope: true rlib/separate-compilation generics (Q16's
      flat-merge is the model).
- [ ] **Q17b · S4 — generic METHOD over a mixin (staged remainder).** A generic
      `def measure[T: Sized](item: &var T)` INSIDE a class still resolves the bound
      method to a placeholder; lowering rejects it with a clear diagnostic
      ("move the generic into a free function"). Extend the Q17 free-fn
      monomorphization to class/struct/enum methods: collect generic-method
      instantiations, emit specialized method bodies (`Frame_measure__mono__Wide`),
      redirect the method/field-access call sites. Not on quiver's critical path
      (its paint pass is all free functions).
- [ ] **Q2 · S1 — `Option[any Fn[...]]` class field returns garbage.** ⏸ Deferred
      pending the closure representation redesign; apps work around with index-into-pool arrays.
- [ ] **Q22 — closure captures are pointer-copies.** ✅ Audited 2026-06-08 post-P0.2:
      **SOUND, not a UAF** (S4, not the feared S1). Now that `Drop` runs, a captured
      class local is permanently tainted out of the drop set by the capture's
      `SetField` (`drops.rs:728` / `closure.rs:136-150`), so it is **not freed** and the
      stored closure's pointer does not dangle — it **leaks** instead (lives to process
      exit). Does NOT gate the next Drop increment. Open item is the owning-capture /
      keep-alive design (Q4 prerequisite) so escaped handles are freed deterministically
      instead of leaked. Verdict + mechanism in `dev/gui-stack-v1-issues.md` §Q22.
- [x] **Q23 · S4 — `ruxen fmt` is destructive** ✅ FIXED 2026-06-08. (a) Nested
      class/struct/enum/impl/mixin method `##` docs are now emitted
      (`format_func_with_leading_comments`). (b) The shared parser accepts a clean
      top-level expression statement (`TopLevelItem::Expr`) so `ruxen fmt`
      round-trips `Tester.describe` test files; the direct compile path rejects it
      with the new E0728 (`ruxen test` wraps in `def main` and is unaffected).
      Pin: `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q23_fmt_nondestructive.rs`; doc
      `docs/errors/E0728.md`.
- [x] **Q24 · S4 — stale incremental cache replays false move/borrow diagnostics**
      ✅ FIXED 2026-06-08. The cache key's toolchain component was just
      `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`, invariant across a `--from-source` rebuild, so stale
      objects (with the old compiler's borrow behaviour) were replayed. `compile.rs`
      now folds a `toolchain` fingerprint (exe path + size + mtime) into the cache
      flags, and `CacheKey` gained a `flags` component so the per-object key
      reflects it. Pin: `cache_key_differs_on_flags`.
- [x] **Q25 · S1 — `Hash.key?`/`get` on an EMPTY hash SEGFAULTS**; `&Hash`/`&Set`
      params unsound. ✅ FIXED 2026-06-08. (a) The `string_keys` tristate (-1 unset)
      was C-truthy, so empty-table lookups `strcmp`'d an int key as a `char*` —
      `hash.c` now tests `> 0`. (b) The `&Hash`/`&Set` "unsoundness" was a free-fn
      false-positive E1118 on `&Hash[K,V]` (the `Hash → Hashable` alias); now both
      free fns and methods accept the sound `&Hash[K,V]` collection ref (like
      `&Array[Int]`), and the bare `&Hash` mixin ref is still rejected. Pins:
      `tests/release-e2e/cases/617_*`, `618_*`, `619_*` +
      `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q25_hash_set_soundness.rs`.
- [x] **Q26 · S1 — capturing closure stored under a `&var *self` reborrow loses its
      captures** ✅ FIXED 2026-06-08. Root cause: a closure nested inside another
      closure's body never re-captured a variable the OUTER block captured
      (`capture_map` was excluded from the visible-defs set). Closure lowering now
      treats `def_to_local ∪ capture_map` as visible and fills re-capture slots from
      the enclosing captures pointer. Unblocks reactive `dyn_text`/`button` children
      in quiver containers. Pins: `tests/release-e2e/cases/615_*`, `616_*` +
      `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q26_nested_closure_capture.rs`.
- [x] **Q28 · S1 — enum variant `Float`/`Float32` payloads (claimed miscompile)**
      ✅ FIXED / already sound 2026-06-09 (feat/drop-elaboration). The
      `canvas/src/event.rx` `Int`-coordinate TODO ("return to Float32 payloads once
      enum float payloads work") is STALE — like Q22, the note outlived the defect.
      Enum `Float`/`Float32` payloads round-trip exactly (named + positional, single +
      double, mixed with `Int` variants, through fns + Arrays, sub-pixel values). The
      typed MIR `SetField`/`GetField` slot path stores/loads each float at its own
      width; an f32 literal is `coerce_value`-narrowed to f32 in `Assign` before the
      constructor. Fixed as a side effect of Q5 + the case-218 / `1b6ced0` float-codegen
      work. No code change; pinned as a regression guard. Pins:
      `tests/release-e2e/cases/647_enum_float32_payload`, `648_enum_float_mixed_payload`
      + `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q28_enum_float_payload.rs`. Affected site
      `canvas/src/event.rx` can revert to `Float32` (canvas owner).
- [x] **Q29 · S1 — borrowed `&String` into a `lib "C"` FFI call (claimed wrong
      pointer)** ✅ FIXED / NOT-A-BUG 2026-06-09. A borrowed `&String` forwards the
      correct data pointer + recoverable length today: a Ruxen `String` IS a bare
      NUL-terminated `char*` (no length header), and `MirInst::Ref` is by-value, so the
      `char*` passes through unchanged; C recovers length via `strlen`. The old "char
      count / wrong pointer" claim described the legacy `measure_text_n_raw(n: Int)`
      workaround, not `&String`. Evidence: a borrowed `&String` through `include?`/
      `find`/`replace`/`starts_with` returns exact byte-offset/length-sensitive results.
      Pins: `tests/release-e2e/cases/649_ffi_borrowed_string_arg` +
      `compiler/ruxen_core/tests/q29_ffi_borrowed_string.rs`. Canvas deviation note +
      redundant `measure_text_n_raw` fallback can be reverted (canvas owner).

## Open now — pre-flight P0s (`requirements/ROADMAP.md`)

The P0 list blocks tiers downstream. **It predates recent compiler work and its
file paths reference the old `crates/` layout — re-audit against the current tree
before picking one up** (several may be partially landed; check `CHANGELOG.md`).
Highest-leverage, still-relevant:

- [x] **P0.2 — real `Drop` elaboration (RESOLVED; premise stale).** `MirInst::Drop`
      is an inert marker; `insert_drops` (`mir/lower/drops.rs`) emits per-type free +
      user-destructor calls at scope exit, gated by `compute_dealloc_safe_locals` so a
      moved / returned / FFI-moved value is never dropped. Proven: `drop_fixtures.rs` +
      `user_drop_runs.rs` 19/19, `outstanding == 0`. ADR: `docs/decisions/drop-elaboration.md`.
      Remaining tier1_04 work (drop flags for conditional moves, drop-on-unwind,
      Copy/Clone) is separate and still open.
- [ ] **P0.5 — unresolved generic method calls fall back to `ruxen_noop_passthrough`**
      (silent no-op). Violates the "no silent no-op" rule.
- [ ] **P0.15 — variance rules encoded as comments only; no fixtures prove them.**
- [ ] Remainder (P0.1, P0.3–P0.14): triage against current tree.

## GUI-stack critical path (what `canvas`/`quiver` are waiting on)

The GUI stack (`../canvas`, `../quiver`) has shipped its first vertical slice
but its next cycles are gated here. Prioritized by blast radius:

- [x] **P0.2 — real `Drop` elaboration (RESOLVED).** Heap-owning locals
      (Class/Struct/Enum + String/Array/Map/Set) are freed and user `def drop`
      destructors run at scope exit, in reverse declaration order, exactly once;
      moved / returned / FFI-moved values are never dropped (no double-free /
      use-after-free). The no-GC deterministic-teardown value prop is realized for
      the normal-scope-exit case. Both backends honour it (the free is a MIR `Call`,
      so Cranelift and LLVM behave identically; `MirInst::Drop` itself is an inert
      marker). Leak-audit pin: `drop_fixtures.rs` asserts `outstanding == 0` across
      19 cases. ADR: `docs/decisions/drop-elaboration.md`. **Still open:** drop flags
      for conditionally-moved locals, drop-on-unwind (panic=abort only today),
      Copy/Clone mixins.
- [x] **Q17 — generic-free-fn / mixin-bound monomorphization (FIXED for free
      fns, feat/drop-elaboration).** A generic free function over a mixin now
      monomorphizes per consumer-defined implementor, so quiver's
      single-`PaintSurface` cap is lifted — multiple paint backends now compile +
      run. Generic-calling-generic handled via a worklist fixpoint. **Unblocks:**
      multiple paint backends + clean L1/L2 generic seams. Generic METHODS over a
      mixin remain staged (Q17b above; clear diagnostic, no placeholder symbol).
- [x] **Q16 — dependency symbols in library/`check`/`test` builds (FIXED,
      feat/drop-elaboration).** Dep `src/**.rx` is now flat-merged into library
      (`compile_piece`), `check`, and `ruxen test` builds via the shared
      `build::gather_dep_sources` + `build::resolve_dep_source_dirs` — not just
      binary builds. Symbols enter by source flat-merge (one object, no
      extern-rlib link), so binary builds are unchanged and there is no
      duplicate-symbol risk. Pins: `src/ruxen_cli/tests/dep_visibility.rs`,
      `test_runner` synth-order unit test. ADR:
      `docs/decisions/q16-dep-symbols-in-lib-check-test-builds.md`.
      **Unblocks:** quiver/rondo unit-testing their own public API instead of
      through a sibling binary.
- [x] **Q26 — closure capture lost under `&var *self` reborrow.** ✅ FIXED
      2026-06-08. **Unblocks:** reactive `dyn_text`/`button` children inside quiver
      `Row`/`Col` containers (the widget library's core; previously only static
      `text` children worked in containers). S1.
- [ ] **Enum float payloads + FFI `&String` pointer bugs.** canvas works around
      both (pointer coords forced to `Int`; `measure_text` forwards a char count
      not the string). File/repro as `Q##` if not yet tracked, then canvas
      reverts its deviations. **Unblocks:** correct float event coords + real
      text advance widths.

## Long-horizon

Tiers 1–5 in [`requirements/ROADMAP.md`](requirements/ROADMAP.md): stdlib
completeness & concurrency/async/drop (T1) → type-system features (T2) →
tooling/DX incl. LSP, debugger, docgen, incremental compile (T3) → ecosystem,
package manager, cross-compile, WASM, stable ABI (T4) → spec & stability,
language reference, edition/deprecation, error-code registry (T5). Gate is
`prompts/v1/25_v1_release_checklist.md`.

## How to update this file

- Land a fix → check its box here (or remove it), add the `CHANGELOG.md` entry,
  pin the `tests/release-e2e/cases/` case, and flip the status in the source doc
  (`gui-stack-v1-issues.md` / `requirements/ROADMAP.md`).
- A sibling app hits a new compiler quirk → add a `Q##` entry to
  `dev/gui-stack-v1-issues.md` with a repro, then surface it here under "Open now".
